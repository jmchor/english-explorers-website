## What is it?

A website for "English Explorers", a Mainz-based meet-up for kids (and their parents) who's native language is English.

### But what is it?

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). I decided to get my toes wet with NextJS, and this low-key website project proved perfect for it.
